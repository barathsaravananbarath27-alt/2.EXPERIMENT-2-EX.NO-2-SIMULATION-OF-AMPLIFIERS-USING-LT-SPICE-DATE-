**EX.NO:** 2 SIMULATION OF AMPLIFIER INVERTING, NON INVERTING , DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER AND INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIERS USING LT SPICE
DATE: 

**  


## AIM  : To simulate the performance of  INVERTING, NON INVERTING , DIFFERENTIAL AND INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIERS  circuits using LT- SPICE                



## PROCEDURE:

1.Double click on LT- SPICE  icon.
2.New schematic window open.
3.Pick and paste the required component from the library and draw the circuit diagram .
4.Complete the connection.
5.Save the file by giving file name.
6.Click on the run option ->click advanced open ->select Ac analysis->enter the amplitude-> time delay stop time value.
7.Click on the run option ->simulationwindow opens->place the probe ->output graph is obtained
